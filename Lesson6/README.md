### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this assignment, I learned that in order to create a new element node using the createElement() method of the Document object, you use document.createElement("element").
2. I also learned that you can attach nodes to each other. To do this, you specify the node to be attached and the node to attach it to.
3. Finally, I learned that you can clone nodes using a true or false boolean.
